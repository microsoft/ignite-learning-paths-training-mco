Welcome!

The content of this repository is available for you so you can reproduce any demo or learn how to present any session of the Learning Path presented at [Migrosoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite) and during [Microsoft Ignite The Tour](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/ignite-the-tour/), in your local field office, a community user group, or even as a lunch-and-learn event for your company.

## Do the Demos

If you are here to reproduce a demo in the comfort of your home/office, go in in the section [Sessions](#sessions). In each session you will find deployment instructions, to create the environment you need, and a tutorial to do the demo step by step.

## Presenting the content

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team.

Along with the video of the presentation, this repository will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions & code.

## Sessions

Here all the sessions available in the learning path **Managing Cloud Operations** (aka: **MCO**)

### [MCO10: IaaS VM Operations](./mco10/README.md)  

In recent months, Tailwind Traders has been having issues with keeping their sprawling IaaS VM deployment under control, leading to mismanaged resources and inefficient processes.  
In this session, look into how Tailwind Traders can ensure their VMs are properly managed and maintained with the same care in Azure as they were in Tailwind Trader's on-premises data centers.


### [MCO11: Securing Azure IaaS virtual machines](./mco11/readme.md) 

In this 15-20 Minute Theatre session, learn the top five things that you can do to improve the security posture of your Azure IaaS VMs, including secure administration practices, security configuration management, as well as being notified of critical security events.


### [MCO20: Azure Governance and Management](./mco20/README.md) 

Tailwind Traders‚Äô deployments are occurring in an ad hoc manner, primarily driven by lack of protocol and unapproved decisions by various operators or employees. Some deployments even violate the organization's compliance obligations, such as being deployed in an unencrypted manner without DR protection. After bringing their existing IaaS VM fleet under control, Tailwind Traders wants to ensure future deployments comply with policy and organizational requirements.  

In this session, walk through the processes and technologies that will keep Tailwind Traders‚Äô deployments in good standing with the help of Azure Blueprints, Azure Policy, role-based access control (RBAC), and more.
