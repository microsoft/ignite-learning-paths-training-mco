![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-MCO-fe5e00?logo=microsoft) 


## Session Abstract

This 20 minute theatre session provides an overview of steps that you can take to improve the security posture of Azure IaaS VMs, including secure administration practices, security configuraiton management, as well as being notified of critical security events.

## Session Story

In this session youâ€™ll cover a collection of steps that you can take to secure IaaS VMs running in Azure. Rather than provide demos, due to the time constraints screenshots have been displayed where appropriate. You'll give a general overview of some important security features and how they can be used to improve the security of IaaS VMs:
- Secure the administrative plane
- Azure software updates
- Azure Firewall, NSG, and NVA
- Endpoint Protection
- Bastion and JiT Access
- Adaptive Application Control
- Disk Encryption
- File Integrity Monitoring.
You'll provide a brief overview of each feature and how it might be used. You only have 20 minutes, so you need to keep moving and only provide a few minutes per feature.
